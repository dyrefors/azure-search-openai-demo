## Search page

The Search page allows the user to search for documents across all the different pages of the system, using a ‘Basic’ or ‘Advanced’ search. 

The Search page is accessed by either clicking on ‘Search’ in the Top bar, or by the method described in the Toolbox section above (by clicking on the magnifying glass, typing in a word, and pressing enter/return on the keyboard). 

### Basic search (only 'Text' field')
This is the default search when the user first opens the Search page, it contains the ‘Text’ field only which searches both name and content of the files. 

To perform a basic search, type a word in the Text field that's known to be in the filename or the contents of the document then click the 'Search' button. Any document with the word in its filename or contents will be returned, including pdfs if the file has gone through optical character recognition. 
 
Use this Search function if the user:
•	Does not know the page the file is on; 
•	Knows some or all of the file name; or
•	Knows some words the file contains. 


### Advanced search (many field options)
The advanced search option allows the user to specify more detailed search parameters such as metadata associated to the document (document types and keywords), the date the file was last modified, the last modifier, the file type (.docx, .pdf, etc).

To perform an advanced search, from the 'Basic' search mentioned above, click the 'Advanced search' link and additional search fields appear. Fill in the relevant fields and click the 'Search' button. Any documents meeting those parameters will be returned in the results. 

Use this Search function if the user:
•	Knows some information (such as when it was modified and by whom) but not a great deal about the file(s).
•	To see a list of documents with similar metadata (i.e. with the same Document type or keyword) or to search for documents by modifier. 




### Results list
The results list is made up of a series of columns to help the user refine the results and find what they're looking for.
* ***Sort*** - click on the column header to change the sort order of the list; an arrow will appear next to the column header title to show which column the list is sorted on and whether it's ascending or descending.
* ***Filter further*** - change the search paramenters to reduce the number of documents displayed further
* ***Preview*** - hover over a document to generate a preview of the contents. 
* ***Open the file*** - click on the name of a file to open 
* ***Open the filepath*** - click on the filepath to go to the page and folder where the document is saved. 
* ***Clear*** - click on the 'Clear' button to remove the previous parameters and start a new search.




### Tips using this search function
•	For a file to appear in the results in the Search page, it must have been uploaded approximately 10-20 minutes earlier in order for the search to pick it up. 
•	It looks at both the name and content of files including pdfs if they have optical character recognition.
•	It searches files across the system in all entities, it doesn’t search for folders



Note: There is a search function specific to each page is available on Documents tab. This function is less advanced than the Search page function described above but is helpful to find known folders or files within a page.


## 3. Start Page

The deputy function does not change other permissions such as page membership or access to documents with limited permissions. 

During the period the deputy assignment is active, both the original user and the deputy will receive email notifications of tasks assigned as well as see the tasks on their respective Start page ‘My tasks and milestones’ boxes. Tasks completed by deputies display as ‘on behalf of':

Email notifications are sent automatically by the system when a user is assigned as responsible for an activity or milestone, or when a user has been asked to review or approve an activity or milestone. The deputy will receive these same email notifications for the duration they are a 'deputy'.


#### **To assign a deputy:**
* Go to the Start page
* In the Toolbox in the top right of the page, click on the three dots Context menu, in the list click on 'Manage deputies'.
* A form appears enabling the user to select up to two deputies:

## 5. Projects

### PROJECTS
Link to <a href="javascript:void(0)" resource-url="ngo_online_url/GuidanceLibrary/06 General/ProMIS Guidance Project.pptx?Web=1">ProMIS Guidance Project.pptx</a>
Projects are created via approved Ideas (or manually by Admins or Project/Programme creators). 
Project pages provide a space where project activities and progress can be managed, documentation can be developed, and the project can be monitored. 

### PROJECTS in ProMIS
All project ideas and projects are approved in ProMIS. It is crucial to select the right project set-up **already in the project idea form** as the information and workflow required in the future project varies: 
*	Development (QPRG project development and approval)
*	Sudden onset (QPRG sudden onset)
*	CBM Own implementation (Guidance note)

For CBM own implementation projects and projects implemented in a non-programme country (interregional projects), financial information will not be added to ProMIS. The payments will be processed in BC and financial reporting will take place in PowerBI. 
## 5.1 Overview

**Project Overview** 

This tab provides a high-level overview of the information about the project stored in this project page, or elsewhere in ProMIS. The overview box is the same for all projects. 

Most boxes pull their information from specific tabs, the following ones require manual filling: 

* Information box pulls key date from the project form. The users can view or edit the project information box 
* Project status box displays the overall status of the project in terms of time, scope, and budget. The users can view or edit the project status.


 
## 5.2 Create / edit / view Projects

**Naming convention for projects:**

1. Initiative/Sector (Abbreviation or complete description) 
1. Component / Specific intervention 
1. Target group 
1. Example: IEH-Outreach-Children with disability 

Optional fields for the name include: donor (for example, LCDF projects or when requested), specific geographical area and partner acronym. 

**Components included**

Make sure this field is thoroughly filled as it will be used by the fundraisers to select suitable projects for specific donors. 

 **Initiatives**

The **percentage** relating to the Initiative(s) field refers to the **allocated budget**. 
In regard to Project pages, these are usually automatically created when an idea is approved. In this case, the data in the project idea and attached documents are taken over to the new project page. 

 **Project start, end date and admin date**

The project’s start and end date is provided in line with the Contract and the project operations. In the initial stage estimations can be used and concretised later.  

The Admin end date field is populated with a date six months past the End date of the project. Until this Admin end date, users will be able to process project data. 

**Project description**

Provide an illustrative project description for the Fundraisers that 

* gives some background information (location etc) 
* describes what you want to achieve 
* explains the need of the planned action (e.g. low health infrastruture, high cataract backlog therefore support of surgeries and training). 
* describes the target group (type of disability, how big is each target group (estimated number) 
* what concretely you want to do for the target group (e.g. construction, service delivery, investment in machines or any other tangible goods).

## 5.3 Project Documents Tab

The Project document tab has a standard folder structure for all CBM projects. Guidance where to save documents can be found here: <a href="javascript:void(0)" resource-url="ngo_online_url/GuidanceLibrary/06 General/Document management in ProMIS.pdf">Document management in ProMIS.pdf</a>

* Transactions 
## 5.4.1 Budget

The ‘Budget’ sub-tab provides a space to manage the project budget and forecast and view the total funding allocated to the Project from Funding pages. 

**Key considerations**: 

* For CBM own implementation projects and projects implemented in a non-programme country (interregional projects), financial information will not be added to ProMIS. The payments will be processed in BC and financial reporting will take place in PowerBI. 
* In line with the core ops, only a single row (one-line) total budget (CBM standard) or exceptionally (Legally Contracted Designated Funding projects) add a more detailed budget (with header rows, sub-rows etc) as needed. 
* Budgets need to be entered in planning currency for every year of the project duration. 

## 5.4.2 Transfers

Transfers are started from the Project page via Finance -> Transfers. The transfer sub-tab becomes active once the project has moved to the phase “Implementation & Monitoring” 

Third Party Payments are handled by Transaction Management. All necessary data and supporting documents should be sent to finance@cbm.org 

## 5.4.3 Expenditure

The Expenditure sub-tab a provides a space for users to: 

* view a read-only expenditure summary table of the project’s annual budget vs expenditure to date. 
* manually report on actual expenditure against the project budget on a quarterly basis. 

Once published, the expenditure for the period will automatically appear in the Expenditure sub-tab of the Project which shows a read-only summary of the project’s annual budget vs expenditures to date. 
## 5.4.4 Transactions

In this tab all transfers to the partner (initiated from ProMIS) and all third-party payments (initiated from Business Central) are listed as read-only reference. 
## 5.5 Contracts

Agreement files are saved in the Documents tab and linked to the entries. If an agreement is linked to another page (e.g. to a Partner), that agreement will also appear on that linked page’s Agreements tab. The original page is shown in the ‘Source page’ column.

## 6. Programmes

Link to <a href="javascript:void(0)" resource-url="ngo_online_url/GuidanceLibrary/06 General/ProMIS Guidance Programme.pptx?Web=1">ProMIS Guidance Programme.pptx</a> 

The Programme entity will be used to capture multi-country contracts and/or implementation scenarios where two or more projects are contributing to the same objectives and need to be grouped/rolled-up to a shared programme for greater visibility and oversight.  

For scenarios where the ‘Idea-approval’ process leads to a Programme rather than a Project (e.g. for multi-country implementations), the ‘final approval’ process is done via project cycle tab when the associated Project pages are created. 

A Programme page can be created from an approved Idea or manually by certain permission groups (e.g. Administrators). 

*For examples*: Projects which are implemented in more than one country with more than one partner. 

**It is good practice to always check that a page doesn't already exist before creating it.**

## 6.0 Browse list

The Browse lists are accessible by clicking on the “Programme” Entity on the Top bar. 
After clicking the Programme entity, a list of all programmes will be displayed in the screen.

**For information on the functions of the tabs please refer to the Helptext section on “Navigation”**
## 7.6 Funding cycle

The Funding cycle tab is a standard list of tasks organized in phases and steps.  

The steps are tasks and milestones which guide the user through the required or recommended way of working for CBM as outlined in the various Quick Process Reference Guides (QPRGs). 

The Funding cycle allows the management of fundings from either institutional or major donors and includes major steps such as the go-no go decision and the handover from institutional donor & philanthropy team to programme delivery teams. 
## 7.8 Finance


## 7.8.1 Funding plan

The Finance- Funding Plan tab is a space for users to display the agreed financial contribution from donor and CBM for the respective funding proposal. The page always automatically displays the last approved version of the funding plan. 

Enter the agreed contribution from the donor per funding year. 
In case an additional funding source e.g. matching contribution from CBM click on “add funding source”, select the respective funding source (e.g. “CBM Matching funds”) and enter the amounts for the additional funding source.

Under the section Cost Structure Breakdown define which part of the funding goes to the project and which is been used for cost recovery (e.g. administration fee BMZ, or any other amounts that are to cover CBM infrastructure costs). 

Details for cost recovery: 

* Donor-approved administrative costs for CBMI (“overheads”, e.g. 4-14 % BMZ ) 
* Country office costs channeled via the CO cost center/ BC (e.g. audits, evaluations) 
* RHO international monitoring visits (travel costs) of the Project Delivery teams. 
* Costs paid from Bensheim (consultancy costs or others, such as PEEK) 

The cost recovery (admin), project funds and any additional free funds has to match with the finance data in the contract with the donor. 

The total sum in the funding plan (donor contribution plus all other funding sources) has to match the costs mentioned in the contract with the donor, and has to be exactly the same as the total sum of project funds and cost recovery.  
These amounts can either be saved as preliminary or confirmed funding plans. Only confirmed funding plans allow allocation of funds to specific projects. 
## 7.8.2 Allocations

The Finance- Allocation tab is a space for users to allocate money from the funding to a specific project. The allocated amount will display on the project card as incoming funding. 

When adding an allocation, select the respective project from the dropdown menu, enter the year and the amount of money in contract currency that goes to the partner (project funds). Enter 0 for the cost recovery amount (e.g. administration fee) that stays with CBM. 

This has to be repeated for every year of the funding period indicated on the funding page. 

An entry made can either be saved as preliminary or confirmed allocations. 
Preliminary allocations will appear in italics in the allocation overview. 

Only confirmed allocations will enable projects to call up funds. 
## 7.8.3 Income schedule

The Finance - Income Schedule tab is a space for users to first plan and then **capture the actual income payments from the donor** to this specific fund.

* less formally agreed arrangements, such as e-mails of consent. 

These documents can either be uploaded in the document library of the respective funding page first and then can be linked in the Agreements tab or they can be uploaded while creating a new agreement entry (first select the folder for saving the document then click the upload button to browse your files).

### Partner Page Fields


#### Partnership Category:

**Prospective:**
Relationships with organisations that focus on piloting of prospective strategic partnerships or capacity development of organisations.

**Project:** 
Partnerships that are developed to respond and deliver a specific project e.g. respond to a funding opportunity arising during the year. After project end, the organisation either becomes a strategic partner or a collaboration partner.

**Strategic:**
Partnerships that are based on a shared vision and long-term commitment to a jointly agreed objective  (i.e. could include several project cycles).

**Collaboration:**
Partnerships that are not based on project funding e.g. advocacy campaigns, technical working groups, exchange of information, etc. If the Organisation receives funds from CBM, the partnership will become a project partnership or strategic partnership.

Link to <a href="javascript:void(0)" resource-url="ngo_online_url/GuidanceLibrary/06 General/ProMIS Guidance CBM Teams.pptx?Web=1">ProMIS Guidance CBM Teams.pptx</a>

A CBM Teams page allows work associated to a team to be visible in one location. It also provides users with a space to store their team-related documentation, such as meeting minutes, team planning and organograms. 

Folders for sub-teams or particular roles can be created in the Documents tab to help users move away from using their desktops to store documents that may not be directly related to another page (such as technical advisors developing guidance documentation). All files under Teams are visible to all ProMIS users. Confidential files should be stored in locked folders. 

For CBM, the CBM team entity will be used to support the various teams within CBM that manage the work in ProMIS.

## 11. Geography

Overarching pages that allow all work associated with a particular geographic location to be visible in one place. There are two different 'levels' of Geography pages in ProMIS: Countries and Regions. These pages provide a space to store country or region-specific information/documentation (e.g. Country Strategies, Fact Sheets, Security etc.).  

## 12. Add, view and edit a Risk entry

This ‘risk form’ follows the logic of general risk management and starts with the identification of risks. The next step is to evaluate the severity and impact of the risk (rating), and to set priorisation. The third step is to decide how to respond to identified risks (mitigation), and the last step is to monitor the risks and implement responses.

**RISK IDENTIFICATION** <br>
-	Risk category: Select the appropriate category.
-	Risk type: Select a more detailed classification of the risk category.
-	Risk description: Describe more detailed the risk event.
-	Risk outcome: Describe the negative impact of the risk to the project objectives. 

**RISK BEFORE MITIGATION (gross rating)** <br>
Rate your risk in selecting the impact and the likelihood. The estimate goes from 1-5, whereby 5 is the highest. The rating will automatically appear.

**RISK MITIGATION** <br>
-	Mitigation strategy: Decide on your strategy to handle the risk. 
-	Mitigation measure: Define measure that would reduce the negative impact to the project objectives.

**RISK AFTER MITIGATION (net rating)** <br>
Considering the defined mitigation measure, rate again the rest risk by selecting the impact and the likelihood. The estimate goes from 1-5, whereby 5 is the highest. The rating will automatically appear.

**RISK MONITORING** <br>
-	Risk owner: Select an individual, responsible for the risk mitigation.
-	Next status update: Insert the date of the expected completion for the mitigation actions. This ensures that the risk is properly monitored. 
-	Updates on review: Optional field to document any comments related to the risk.
-	Risk status: Set the status on active if the risk is present or select closed if the risk is not valid anymore.
